HOG Tool
========

By William Blum. 2007-2017


HOG is tool used to explore to experiment with the game semantics inspired theory of traversals studied in my DPhil thesis. Traversals are used to model higher-order computations such as
lambda terms, higher order recursion schemes, or higher-order pushdown automata.
Features:
Features:
- Let's you "play" interactively with the game denotation of a lambda term or higher-order grammar
- Normalize a term by calculating the cores of the traversals of an STLC traversal
- Calculate P-views, O-views, subterm projections, core projections (i.e. Hereditary projection with respect to the root)
- Generate the equivalent Collapsible Pushdown Automaton calculating the traversals of a given higher-order recursion grammar
- Calculate the tree generated by a higher-order grammar
- Export LaTeX justification sequences to be typeset with the pstring package

The tool is written in OCaml and F# can be downloaded from  http://william.famille-blum.org/research/tools.html

## Building

As of 2017 the project now builds using [FAKE](https://fake.build/).

> Back in 2008, `msbuild` and `Visual Studio` build tools did not work out-of-the box on Linux.
> In order to support building on Linux, [OMake](http://omake.metaprl.org/index.html) was chosen
> as the primary build system used for the project, using custom OMake rule to add support for F# and C# in Omake. The original release from October 2008 was built on tested with version 1.9.6.2.
> 10 years later, the F# tooling support on Linux has significantly improved so it should be possible to build the project on Linux using
> `msbuild`, though I have not tested it.

### Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to build HOG:
- [F# compiler F# 4.1](http://fsharp.org/)
- [C# compiler (included in the .Net ramework)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=en)
- Resource compiler (resgen.exe), comes with the [.NET SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=fe6f2099-b7b4-4f47-a244-c96d69c35dec&displaylang=en)
as well as the [Windows SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=C2B1E300-F358-4523-B479-F53D234CDCCF&displaylang=en), install either of them.

### Build commands

To compile run the following commands:

    .\.paket\paket.bootstrapper.exe
    .\.paket\paket.exe restore
    .\packages\FAKE\tools\Fake.exe  build

## Installation

Just unzip the binary package and run `HOG.exe`.

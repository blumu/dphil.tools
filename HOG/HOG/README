== Compilation:

    Requirement: + Omake build system
                    (http://omake.metaprl.org/index.html)
                 + Microsoft GLEE .NET graph layout engine
                    (http://research.microsoft.com/~levnach/GLEEWebPage.htm)
    To compile just run omake in the HOG subdirectory:
        omake
        
    Optional parameters:
        -for compatibility with the Mono platform:
            omake MONO=
        -for debug build:
            omake DEBUG=

        
== History
0.0.2
    + New feature that lets you load a simply-typed lambda term-in-context and construct its compuation tree. A type inference algorithm is implemented to avoid to have to declare the type of the variable in the lambda abstractions.
    + Exportation of the computation tree/graph to Latex using the PSTricks package
    + Build system based on OMake
    
0.0.1
    + initial version for Higher-order grammars and Pushdown automaton

== Compilation:

    Requirement: + Omake build system
                    http://omake.metaprl.org/index.html
                 + F# (tested with version 1.9.3.7):
                    http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx
                 + C# compiler (included in the .Net 2.0 Framework)
                    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=en
                 + Microsoft Windows SDK (for the resgen.exe utility)
                    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=C2B1E300-F358-4523-B479-F53D234CDCCF&displaylang=en
                 + Microsoft GLEE .NET graph layout engine
                    http://research.microsoft.com/~levnach/GLEEWebPage.htm
    
    To compile just run omake in the directory where you have uncompressed the HOG zip file:
        omake

    The following environment variables need to be set:
        FXTOOLS (default to C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727)
        WINDOWS_SDK (default to C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0)
		
    Optional parameters:
        -for compatibility with the Mono platform:
            omake FORMONO=
        -for compilation with the Mono toolchain:
            omake WITHMONO=
        -for debug build:
            omake DEBUG=

== Examples

See the OMakefile used in the project HOG (http://william.famille-blum.org/research/hog_src.zip)

== History
0.0.2
    + New feature that lets you load a simply-typed lambda term-in-context and construct its compuation tree. A type inference algorithm is implemented to avoid to have to declare the type of the variable in the lambda abstractions.
    + Exportation of the computation tree/graph to Latex using the PSTricks package
    + Build system based on OMake
    
0.0.1
    + initial version for Higher-order grammars and Pushdown automaton
